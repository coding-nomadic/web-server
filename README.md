Web Server Project
This project is a multi-threaded web server designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. It currently supports the following HTTP methods:

GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Submit data to be processed by the server.
PUT: Update existing data on the server.
DELETE: Remove data from the server.
Features
Multi-Request Handling: The server can manage multiple connections at the same time, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.
HTTP Method Support: Implements basic support for common HTTP methods, allowing for a variety of web operations.
Extendable Architecture: The design allows for future enhancements and additional features.
Future Improvements
We plan to continue expanding the server's capabilities, including but not limited to:

Enhanced support for more HTTP methods.
Improved error handling and logging.
Integration of middleware for request processing.
Configuration management for dynamic settings.
